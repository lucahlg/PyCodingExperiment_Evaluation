Let's start by downloading the data from the provided link. I'll download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

The data has been successfully downloaded and extracted. The CSV file wiki4HE.csv is now available in the wiki4he_data directory.


Next, I'll load the data using a data analysis tool (Pandas) to process it and prepare for visualization. Let me install the necessary packages first.

The necessary packages are already installed. Now, I'll load the data from the wiki4HE.csv file and display the first few rows to understand its structure.

It appears that the data is using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter instead of a comma. I'll reload the data with the correct delimiter and display the first few rows again.

The data has been successfully loaded with the correct delimiter. It contains various columns, including demographic information such as age, gender, domain, years of experience, and job position.


Now, let's proceed to provide an overview of the respondents’ demographics, including age, years of experience, domain/field of expertise, and job position. I'll summarize this information and create visualizations for better understanding.

Here is an overview of the respondents’ demographics:


Age

Count: 913
Mean: 42.25 years
Standard Deviation: 8.06 years
Minimum Age: 23 years
Maximum Age: 69 years
Age Distribution: The histogram shows a normal distribution of ages among respondents.

Years of Experience

Count: 913
Unique Values: 37 different years of experience
Most Common Experience: 10 years (77 respondents)

Domain/Field of Expertise

Domain Count:
Domain 6: 361 respondents
Domain 1: 183 respondents
Domain 4: 137 respondents
Domain 5: 101 respondents
Domain 3: 73 respondents
Domain 2: 56 respondents
Unknown: 2 respondents

Job Position

Job Position Count:
Position 6: 659 respondents
Unknown: 113 respondents
Position 2: 68 respondents
Position 3: 50 respondents
Position 4: 18 respondents
Position 1: 3 respondents
Position 5: 2 respondents

Next, I'll visualize the distribution of domains and job positions to provide a clearer picture of the respondents' demographics. Let's create those visualizations.

The visualizations for the distribution of domains and job positions among respondents have been successfully displayed.


Summary of Findings:

The majority of respondents belong to Domain 6, followed by Domain 1 and Domain 4.
Most respondents hold Job Position 6, with a significant number also in the unknown category.

Now that we have completed the overview of the respondents’ demographics, we can move on to the next task, which is to analyze the survey questions answered on a Likert scale and identify which questions received extreme responses from the majority of participants.


Let's proceed with that analysis. I'll first identify the relevant columns for the Likert scale responses and then analyze them.

It appears that there are no questions where the majority of respondents (more than 50%) selected extreme responses (1 or 5) on the Likert scale. This suggests that the responses were more evenly distributed across the scale for all questions.


Next, we can move on to the fourth task, which involves analyzing which domains are most and least likely to consult Wikipedia for issues related to their field of expertise, and comparing this with the practice of citing Wikipedia in academic papers.


I'll start by examining the relevant columns related to Wikipedia usage and domain information. Let's analyze the data for this task.

It seems that there is an issue with the data types in the usage columns, which are likely being interpreted as strings instead of numeric values. I'll convert the relevant columns to numeric types and then re-run the analysis to calculate the average usage of Wikipedia by domain. Let's fix that now.

Here are the average usages of Wikipedia for issues related to the respondents' fields of expertise by domain:


Average Wikipedia Usage by Domain

Unknown Domain (?): 4.00
Domain 2: 2.85
Domain 4: 2.82
Domain 1: 2.53
Domain 6: 2.44
Domain 3: 2.31
Domain 5: 2.06

From this analysis, it appears that respondents from the unknown domain reported the highest average usage of Wikipedia, while those from Domain 5 reported the lowest.


Next, we can compare this data with the practice of citing Wikipedia in academic papers. To do this, we would typically look for any relevant columns in the dataset that indicate citation practices. Let's check the dataset for any columns that might relate to citing Wikipedia in academic work. I'll search for keywords related to citations.

It appears that there are no specific columns in the dataset related to citing Wikipedia in academic papers. This limits our ability to directly compare the usage of Wikipedia with citation practices.


However, we can summarize our findings based on the average usage of Wikipedia by domain and discuss the implications.


Summary of Findings:

Respondents from the unknown domain reported the highest average usage of Wikipedia for issues related to their field.
The average usage decreases across the other domains, with Domain 5 having the lowest average usage.

Without specific citation data, we cannot draw direct comparisons, but we can infer that higher usage of Wikipedia may correlate with a greater reliance on it for information, which could influence citation practices.


If you have any specific questions or if there's anything else you'd like to explore further, please let me know! Otherwise, we can conclude this exploratory data analysis.
