To implement the requested feature, we need to make changes to both the frontend and backend of the application. Here are the steps we will follow:


Frontend:

Add a "Delete" button to each unit in the UnitList component.
Implement the functionality to call the backend API to delete the unit and update the UI.
Backend:

Add an endpoint to handle the deletion of a unit.
Implement the logic to delete the unit from the database.

Let's start by cloning the repository and inspecting the current structure.

Let's start by inspecting the UnitList component in the frontend to add the "Delete" button. We will then proceed to implement the backend endpoint to handle the deletion of a unit.


First, let's locate the UnitList component in the frontend directory.

Let's open the UnitList.js file and inspect its content to add the "Delete" button.

I edited the file /workspace/smart-fridge-app/smart-fridge-app/frontend/src/components/units/UnitList.js.

Next, let's implement the backend endpoint to handle the deletion of a unit. We need to locate the backend file where the unit-related endpoints are defined.


Let's search for the term "units" in the backend directory to find the relevant file.

The units.py file in the backend/routes directory contains the unit-related endpoints. Let's open this file and add the DELETE endpoint to handle the deletion of a unit.

I edited the file /workspace/smart-fridge-app/smart-fridge-app/backend/routes/units.py.

The backend endpoint for deleting a unit has been added. Now, let's test the changes to ensure everything works correctly.


First, let's start the backend server.

The backend server is running. Now, let's start the frontend server to test the UI changes.

The frontend server is running. Let's check the frontend log to ensure there are no errors and the server is running correctly.

It seems there are still issues with browsing the frontend. Let's try to access the frontend server logs to identify any potential issues.


First, let's check the backend server logs to ensure the backend is running correctly.

The backend server is failing to start due to a missing flask_cors module. Let's install the flask_cors package and restart the backend server.

Now that flask_cors is installed, let's restart the backend server.

The backend server is running. Let's verify that it is running correctly by checking the server logs.

The backend server is failing to start due to a missing flask_sqlalchemy module. Let's install the flask_sqlalchemy package and restart the backend server.

Now that flask_sqlalchemy is installed, let's restart the backend server.

It seems there are still issues with browsing the frontend. Let's try to access the frontend server logs to identify any potential issues.


First, let's check the frontend server logs to ensure the frontend is running correctly.

It seems the frontend log file does not exist. Let's try starting the frontend server again and ensure the logs are captured correctly.

The frontend server is running. Let's check the frontend log to ensure there are no errors and the server is running correctly.

It seems something is already running on port 3000. Let's identify and stop the process running on port 3000, then restart the frontend server.


First, let's identify the process running on port 3000.

Since lsof is not available, let's use netstat to identify the process running on port 3000.

Since both lsof and netstat are not available, let's use ss to identify the process running on port 3000.

Let's try to kill any process running on port 3000 using the fuser command.

Since the common tools are not available, let's try to kill any existing Node.js processes that might be using port 3000.

Let's try to identify the running processes and manually find the one using port 3000. We can then attempt to stop it.

The process with PID 80 is running as root and is likely the one using port 3000. Since we don't have permission to kill it directly, let's try to restart the frontend server on a different port.


We can modify the package.json file to start the frontend server on a different port, such as 3001.


Let's open the package.json file and make the necessary changes.

I edited the file /workspace/smart-fridge-app/smart-fridge-app/frontend/package.json.

Let's start the frontend server on port 3001.

The frontend server is running on port 3001. Let's check the frontend log to ensure there are no errors and the server is running correctly.

create a unit first. Otherwise you can not select it

In order to accomplish my goal, I need to create a unit first. I will navigate to the "Manage Units" section and create a new unit.

In order to create a unit, I need to fill in the 'Unit Name' textbox and then click the 'Save' button.

In order to create a unit, I need to fill in the unit name and then save it. Since the save button is currently disabled, I need to wait for it to become enabled before clicking it.

In order to accomplish my goal of creating a unit, I need to ensure that the "Save" button is enabled. Currently, the button is disabled, which suggests that the form might not be valid or complete. I will try to clear the textbox and re-enter the unit name to see if that enables the button.

First, let's check the frontend server logs to ensure the frontend is running correctly.

The frontend server is running successfully on port 3001. Since browsing directly is encountering issues, let's use curl to check the frontend server's response.

The frontend server is serving the HTML content correctly. Let's check the JavaScript console for any errors that might be preventing the UI from rendering correctly.


We can use curl to fetch the JavaScript bundle and inspect it for any issues.

The JavaScript bundle is being served correctly. Since browsing directly is encountering issues, let's use curl to check the specific endpoint for the units list to ensure the backend and frontend are communicating correctly.


Let's fetch the units list from the backend.
