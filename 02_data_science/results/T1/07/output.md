Let's start by downloading the data from the provided link. I'll download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

The data has been successfully downloaded and extracted. The CSV file wiki4HE.csv is now available in the wiki4he_data directory.


Next, I'll load the data using a data analysis tool (Pandas) to process it and prepare for visualization. Let me install the necessary packages first.

The necessary packages are already installed. Now, I'll load the data from the wiki4HE.csv file and display the first few rows to understand its structure.

The data appears to be loaded with semicolons as the delimiter. I'll specify the delimiter while loading the data to ensure it is parsed correctly. Let's reload the data and check its structure again.

The data has been successfully loaded with the correct structure. It contains various columns, including demographic information such as age, gender, domain, years of experience, and job position.


Now, let's proceed to provide an overview of the respondents’ demographics, including age, years of experience, domain/field of expertise, and job position. I'll summarize this information and create visualizations for better understanding.

Here is an overview of the respondents’ demographics:


Age

Count: 913
Mean: 42.25 years
Standard Deviation: 8.06 years
Minimum Age: 23 years
Maximum Age: 69 years
Age Distribution: The histogram shows a normal distribution of ages among respondents.

Years of Experience

Count: 913
Unique Values: 37
Most Common Years of Experience: 10 years (77 respondents)

Domain/Field of Expertise

Domain Count:
Domain 6: 361 respondents
Domain 1: 183 respondents
Domain 4: 137 respondents
Domain 5: 101 respondents
Domain 3: 73 respondents
Domain 2: 56 respondents
Unknown: 2 respondents

Job Position

Job Position Count:
Position 6: 659 respondents
Unknown: 113 respondents
Position 2: 68 respondents
Position 3: 50 respondents
Position 4: 18 respondents
Position 1: 3 respondents
Position 5: 2 respondents

The histograms for age and years of experience have been displayed for visual reference.


Next, let's move on to Task 3, which involves analyzing the survey responses on a Likert scale to identify which questions received extreme responses from the majority of participants. I'll start by examining the relevant columns in the dataset.

Continue

Let's analyze the survey responses to identify which questions received extreme responses (1 or 5) from the majority of participants. I'll check the relevant columns that contain the Likert scale responses and calculate the percentage of extreme responses for each question.

It appears that there are no questions where more than 50% of the respondents selected extreme responses (1 or 5) on the Likert scale. This suggests that the responses are more evenly distributed across the scale for the questions analyzed.


Next, let's move on to Task 4, which involves determining which domains are the most and least likely to consult Wikipedia for issues related to their field of expertise, and comparing this with the practice of citing Wikipedia in academic papers.


I'll analyze the relevant columns to extract this information. Let's start by checking the columns related to Wikipedia usage and domain.

Continue

Let's analyze the data to determine the relationship between the respondents' domains and their likelihood of consulting Wikipedia. I'll focus on the DOMAIN column and the USERWIKI column, which indicates whether they use Wikipedia. Additionally, I'll check the citation practices related to Wikipedia.


I'll calculate the percentage of respondents from each domain who consult Wikipedia and visualize the results. Let's proceed with this analysis.

It seems there was an issue with accessing the value for users who consult Wikipedia. The USERWIKI column may not contain the expected values (1 for yes, 0 for no). Let's first check the unique values in the USERWIKI column to understand its contents. Then, we can proceed with the analysis accordingly.

The USERWIKI column contains the values '0' (not using Wikipedia), '1' (using Wikipedia), and '?' (unknown). The values are stored as strings, which is why the previous analysis failed.


I'll convert the USERWIKI values to numeric, replacing '?' with NaN for proper analysis. Then, I'll recalculate the percentage of respondents from each domain who consult Wikipedia. Let's proceed with this adjustment.

Here are the results regarding the percentage of respondents consulting Wikipedia by domain:


Domain 1: 15.30%
Domain 2: 3.64%
Domain 3: 12.50%
Domain 4: 19.12%
Domain 5: 10.89%
Domain 6: 13.61%
Unknown Domain: 0.00%

The bar chart visualizes the percentage of users consulting Wikipedia for each domain.


Next, we can compare this data with the practice of citing Wikipedia in academic papers. However, the dataset does not seem to contain a direct column for citation practices. If there are specific columns related to citation practices, please let me know, or I can check for any relevant information in the dataset. Would you like me to search for citation-related columns?

Continue

Let's search for any columns in the dataset that might relate to citation practices or any mentions of Wikipedia in academic papers. I'll look for keywords such as "cite," "reference," or "citation" in the column names.

It appears that there are no columns in the dataset specifically related to citation practices or references to Wikipedia in academic papers.


Given this limitation, we can summarize our findings regarding the respondents' demographics and their usage of Wikipedia, but we won't be able to directly compare it with citation practices.


To conclude the analysis:


We provided an overview of the respondents' demographics, including age, years of experience, domain, and job position.
We analyzed the survey responses to identify extreme responses, finding no questions with over 50% extreme responses.
We examined the likelihood of consulting Wikipedia across different domains, revealing varying percentages of usage.

If you have any further questions or need additional analysis, please let me know! Otherwise, I will finalize the task.
