Let's start with Task 1, which is to load the dataset and drop the Region column. First, I will download the dataset from the provided URL and then load it into a DataFrame.

Task 1 is complete. The dataset has been loaded, and the Region column has been dropped.


Now, let's move on to Task 2, which is to filter the data records for clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés (i.e., drop clients from retail). The "Channel" column indicates the type of client, where 1 represents "Retail" and 2 represents "Foodservice". I will filter the DataFrame accordingly.

Task 2 is complete. The data has been filtered to include only clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés.


Now, let's proceed to Task 3, which is to normalize the data by computing the proportionate spending per product category (i.e., each row in the data table sums to one). I will perform this normalization next.

Task 3 is complete. The data has been normalized, and each row now sums to one.


Next, let's move on to Task 4, which is to standardize the data. I will standardize the normalized data using the standard score (z-score) method.

It seems that the sklearn library is not installed in the current environment. I will install it now so that I can proceed with standardizing the data.

The scikit-learn library has been successfully installed. Now, I will proceed to standardize the normalized data using the standard score (z-score) method.

Task 4 is complete. The data has been standardized using the z-score method.


Now, let's move on to Task 5, which is to use K-means to cluster the distributor’s customers based on the standardized data into K = 4 groups. I will perform the clustering now.

Task 5 is complete. The customers have been clustered into 4 groups using K-means clustering.


Now, let's proceed to Task 6, which is to print and visualize the cluster centroids. I will calculate the centroids and create a visualization for them.

Task 6 is complete. The cluster centroids have been printed and visualized.


Now, let's move on to Task 7, which is to offer a short description of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories. I will analyze the cluster centroids to provide these descriptions.

Here are the descriptions of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories:


Cluster 0:

Higher spending on Milk and Delicassen.
Lower spending on Fresh, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Grocery.
Cluster 1:

Significant spending on Grocery and Detergents_Paper.
Lower spending on Fresh, Milk, Frozen, and Delicassen.
Cluster 2:

High spending on Fresh.
Lower spending on Milk, Grocery, Detergents_Paper, and Frozen.
Cluster 3:

Very high spending on Frozen.
Lower spending on Milk, Grocery, and Detergents_Paper, but moderate spending on Fresh and Delicassen.

This concludes the customer segmentation analysis. If you have any further questions or need additional analysis, feel free to ask!
