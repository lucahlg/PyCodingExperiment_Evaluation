Let's start by loading the dataset and inspecting its contents. First, we need to download the dataset from the provided URL and extract it.


I'll begin by downloading and extracting the dataset.

The dataset has been successfully downloaded and extracted. Let's load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and inspect its contents.


I'll start by loading the parkinsons.data file and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.

The dataset has been successfully loaded. It contains 24 columns, including the target variable status, which indicates whether the patient has Parkinson's disease (1) or not (0).


Next, let's clean and normalize the data if necessary. We will:


Drop the name column as it is not useful for our analysis.
Check for any missing values and handle them if present.
Normalize the feature columns.

Let's proceed with these steps.

It seems that the scikit-learn library is not installed. Let's install it first and then proceed with the normalization.

The scikit-learn library has been successfully installed. Let's proceed with normalizing the data and checking for any missing values.


I'll re-run the previous steps to normalize the feature columns and display the first few rows of the normalized DataFrame.

The dataset has been successfully normalized, and there are no missing values.


Next, let's standardize the features by computing the z-scores. This involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature.


I'll proceed with standardizing the features.

The features have been successfully standardized. Now, let's proceed to split the data into training and testing sets.


We'll use an 80-20 split for training and testing data.

The data has been successfully split into training and testing sets. The training set contains 156 samples, and the testing set contains 39 samples.


Next, let's train an L2-regularized logistic regression classifier to predict whether the voice recording comes from a patient who suffers from Parkinsonâ€™s disease. We will use cross-validation to determine the optimal regularization parameter aimed at optimizing the F1 score.


I'll proceed with this step.

The optimal regularization parameter ( C ) for the logistic regression model is 10, and the F1 score on the test set is approximately 0.939.


Next, let's train a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for the same purpose, with ( K ) determined from cross-validation.


I'll proceed with this step.

The optimal number of neighbors ( K ) for the KNN classifier is 1, and the F1 score on the test set is approximately 0.984.


Next, let's train a neural network with a single hidden layer, the width of which is determined from cross-validation.


I'll proceed with this step.

The optimal hidden layer size for the neural network is 10, and the F1 score on the test set is approximately 0.954.


Now, let's test all three classifiers and print the optimal hyperparameters, precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy for each classifier.


I'll proceed with this step.

Here are the results for the three classifiers:


Logistic Regression:


Best Params: {'C': 10}
Precision: 0.912
Recall: 0.969
F1 Score: 0.939
Accuracy: 0.897

K-Nearest Neighbors:


Best Params: {'n_neighbors': 1}
Precision: 1.000
Recall: 0.969
F1 Score: 0.984
Accuracy: 0.974

Neural Network:


Best Params: {'hidden_layer_sizes': (10,)}
Precision: 0.939
Recall: 0.969
F1 Score: 0.954
Accuracy: 0.923

Next, let's compare the performance of these classifiers with class majority assignment as the baseline. This means we will assign every data record the class that appears most frequently in the dataset and calculate the performance metrics.


I'll proceed with this step.

Here are the performance metrics for the baseline classifier (class majority assignment):


Baseline (Class Majority Assignment):


Precision: 0.821
Recall: 1.000
F1 Score: 0.901
Accuracy: 0.821

Comparison with Classifiers:


Metric	Logistic Regression	K-Nearest Neighbors	Neural Network	Baseline
Precision	0.912	1.000	0.939	0.821
Recall	0.969	0.969	0.969	1.000
F1 Score	0.939	0.984	0.954	0.901
Accuracy	0.897	0.974	0.923	0.821

From the comparison, we can see that all three classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Network) outperform the baseline classifier in terms of precision, F1 score, and accuracy. The K-Nearest Neighbors classifier achieves the highest F1 score and accuracy among the three classifiers.
