Let's start by loading the dataset and dropping the Region column.


First, we need to download the dataset from the provided URL and extract it. Then, we will load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and drop the Region column.


Let's begin by downloading and extracting the dataset:

The dataset has been successfully downloaded and extracted. Now, let's load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and drop the Region column.


First, we need to install pandas if it is not already installed. Then, we will load the dataset and drop the Region column.


Let's proceed with these steps:

The dataset has been successfully loaded and the Region column has been dropped. Here is a preview of the first few rows of the dataset:


   Channel  Fresh  Milk  Grocery  Frozen  Detergents_Paper  Delicassen
0        2  12669  9656     7561     214              2674        1338
1        2   7057  9810     9568    1762              3293        1776
2        2   6353  8808     7684    2405              3516        7844
3        1  13265  1196     4221    6404               507        1788
4        2  22615  5410     7198    3915              1777        5185

Next, let's filter the data records for clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés (i.e., drop clients from retail). The Channel column indicates the type of customer: 1 for Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/Café) and 2 for Retail. We will keep only the records where Channel is 1.


Let's proceed with this step:

The data has been successfully filtered to include only clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés. Here is a preview of the first few rows of the filtered dataset:


    Fresh  Milk  Grocery  Frozen  Detergents_Paper  Delicassen
3   13265  1196     4221    6404               507        1788
8    5963  3648     6192     425              1716         750
15  10253  1114     3821     397               964         412
17   5876  6157     2933     839               370        4478
19   7780  2495     9464     669              2518         501

Next, let's normalize the data by computing the proportionate spending per product category (i.e., each row in the data table sums to one).


Let's proceed with this step:

The data has been successfully normalized, with each row summing to one. Here is a preview of the first few rows of the normalized dataset:


       Fresh      Milk   Grocery    Frozen  Detergents_Paper  Delicassen
3   0.484460  0.043680  0.154158  0.233885          0.018516    0.065301
8   0.318979  0.195143  0.331229  0.022735          0.091794    0.040120
15  0.604504  0.065680  0.225282  0.023407          0.056836    0.024291
17  0.284511  0.298116  0.142013  0.040624          0.017915    0.216821
19  0.332095  0.106501  0.403978  0.028557          0.107483    0.021386

Next, let's standardize the data. Standardization involves scaling the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


Let's proceed with this step:

It seems that the scikit-learn library is not installed. Let's install it first and then proceed with standardizing the data.

The scikit-learn library has been successfully installed. Now, let's proceed with standardizing the data.

The data has been successfully standardized. Here is a preview of the first few rows of the standardized dataset:


      Fresh      Milk   Grocery    Frozen  Detergents_Paper  Delicassen
0  0.109896 -0.857327 -0.154208  0.798785         -0.340963    0.290978
1 -0.600937  0.465876  1.261660 -0.944372          1.011400   -0.249572
2  0.625555 -0.665130  0.414498 -0.938823          0.366241   -0.589364
3 -0.748999  1.365469 -0.251318 -0.796688         -0.352063    3.543608
4 -0.544596 -0.308512  1.843364 -0.896306          1.300940   -0.651734

Next, let's use K-means to cluster the distributor’s customers based on these data into ( K = 4 ) groups.


Let's proceed with this step:

The K-means clustering has been successfully applied, and the cluster labels have been added to the standardized data. Here is a preview of the first few rows of the dataset with cluster labels:


      Fresh      Milk   Grocery    Frozen  Detergents_Paper  Delicassen  Cluster
0  0.109896 -0.857327 -0.154208  0.798785         -0.340963    0.290978        3
1 -0.600937  0.465876  1.261660 -0.944372          1.011400   -0.249572        0
2  0.625555 -0.665130  0.414498 -0.938823          0.366241   -0.589364        1
3 -0.748999  1.365469 -0.251318 -0.796688         -0.352063    3.543608        2
4 -0.544596 -0.308512  1.843364 -0.896306          1.300940   -0.651734        0

Next, let's print and visualize the cluster centroids.


Let's proceed with this step:

The cluster centroids have been printed and visualized. Here are the centroids for each cluster:


      Fresh      Milk   Grocery    Frozen  Detergents_Paper  Delicassen
0 -1.316705  0.940767  1.636714 -0.671637          1.734274   -0.396405
1  0.855453 -0.489312 -0.451277 -0.435420         -0.334463   -0.339915
2 -0.936686  1.122738  0.451611 -0.281360         -0.096308    1.553393
3 -0.290602 -0.351864 -0.355285  1.445365         -0.259451   -0.185884

The heatmap visualization of the cluster centroids has also been displayed.


Finally, let's offer a short description of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories.


Cluster 0:

High spending on Grocery and Detergents_Paper.
Moderate spending on Milk.
Low spending on Fresh, Frozen, and Delicassen.
Cluster 1:

High spending on Fresh.
Low spending on Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.
Cluster 2:

High spending on Milk and Delicassen.
Moderate spending on Grocery.
Low spending on Fresh, Frozen, and Detergents_Paper.
Cluster 3:

High spending on Frozen.
Low spending on Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.
