Let's start by loading the dataset and inspecting its contents. First, we need to download the dataset from the provided URL and extract it.


I'll begin by downloading and extracting the dataset.

The dataset has been successfully downloaded and extracted. Let's load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and inspect its contents.


I'll start by loading the parkinsons.data file and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.

The dataset has been successfully loaded and contains 24 columns. The status column indicates whether the patient has Parkinson's disease (1) or not (0).


Next, let's clean and normalize the data if necessary. We will:


Drop the name column as it is not useful for our analysis.
Check for any missing values and handle them if present.
Normalize the data using Min-Max scaling.

Let's proceed with these steps.

It seems that the scikit-learn library is not installed. Let's install it first and then proceed with the data cleaning and normalization.

Now that scikit-learn is installed, let's proceed with cleaning and normalizing the data.


I'll drop the name column, check for any missing values, and normalize the data using Min-Max scaling.

The dataset has been successfully cleaned and normalized. There are no missing values in the dataset.


Next, let's standardize the features by computing the z-scores. This involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature.


I'll proceed with standardizing the features.

The features have been successfully standardized. Now, let's proceed to split the data into training and testing sets.


We'll use an 80-20 split for training and testing data.

The data has been successfully split into training and testing sets. Next, let's train an L2-regularized logistic regression classifier to predict whether the voice recording comes from a patient who suffers from Parkinsonâ€™s disease. We will use cross-validation to determine the optimal regularization parameter aimed at optimizing the F1 score.


Let's proceed with this step.

The optimal regularization parameter ( C ) for the logistic regression model is 10.


Next, let's train a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for the same purpose, with ( K ) determined from cross-validation.


I'll proceed with this step.

The optimal number of neighbors ( K ) for the KNN classifier is 1.


Next, let's train a neural network with a single hidden layer, the width of which is determined from cross-validation.


I'll proceed with this step.

The optimal width for the hidden layer in the neural network is 10.


Now, let's test all three classifiers (logistic regression, KNN, and neural network) and print the optimal hyperparameter, precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy for each.


I'll proceed with this step.

Here are the results for the three classifiers:


Logistic Regression:

Best Parameter: ( C = 10 )
Precision: 0.9118
Recall: 0.9688
F1 Score: 0.9394
Accuracy: 0.8974
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Best Parameter: ( n_neighbors = 1 )
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 0.9688
F1 Score: 0.9841
Accuracy: 0.9744
Neural Network:

Best Parameter: ( hidden_layer_sizes = (10,) )
Precision: 0.9394
Recall: 0.9688
F1 Score: 0.9538
Accuracy: 0.9231

Next, let's compare the performance of these classifiers with class majority assignment as the baseline. The baseline performance is calculated by assigning every data record the class that appears most frequently in the dataset.


I'll proceed with this step.

Here is the comparison of the classifiers' performance with the baseline:


Logistic Regression:

Best Parameter: ( C = 10 )
Precision: 0.9118
Recall: 0.9688
F1 Score: 0.9394
Accuracy: 0.8974
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Best Parameter: ( n_neighbors = 1 )
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 0.9688
F1 Score: 0.9841
Accuracy: 0.9744
Neural Network:

Best Parameter: ( hidden_layer_sizes = (10,) )
Precision: 0.9394
Recall: 0.9688
F1 Score: 0.9538
Accuracy: 0.9231
Baseline:

Precision: 0.8205
Recall: 1.0
F1 Score: 0.9014
Accuracy: 0.8205

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with ( n_neighbors = 1 ) performed the best among the three classifiers, achieving the highest F1 score and accuracy. All three classifiers outperformed the baseline in terms of F1 score and accuracy.
