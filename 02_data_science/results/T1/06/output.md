Let's start by downloading the data from the provided link. I'll download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

The data has been successfully downloaded and extracted. The CSV file wiki4HE.csv is now available in the wiki4he_data directory.


Next, I'll load the data using a data analysis tool (Pandas) to process it for exploratory data analysis. Let me install the necessary packages first.

The necessary packages are already installed. Now, I'll load the data from the wiki4HE.csv file and display the first few rows to understand its structure.

It appears that the data is using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter instead of a comma. I'll reload the data with the correct delimiter and display the first few rows again.

The data has been successfully loaded, and it contains several columns, including demographics such as age, gender, domain, years of experience, and job position.


Now, let's proceed to provide an overview of the respondents’ demographics, including age, years of experience, domain/field of expertise, and job position. I'll summarize this information and create visualizations to represent the findings.


Let's start by summarizing the demographics.

Here's an overview of the respondents’ demographics:


Age

Count: 913
Mean: 42.25 years
Standard Deviation: 8.06 years
Minimum Age: 23 years
Maximum Age: 69 years
25th Percentile: 36 years
Median (50th Percentile): 42 years
75th Percentile: 47 years

Years of Experience

Count: 913
Unique Values: 37
Most Common Value (Top): 10 years (77 respondents)

Domain/Field of Expertise

Domain 6: 361 respondents
Domain 1: 183 respondents
Domain 4: 137 respondents
Domain 5: 101 respondents
Domain 3: 73 respondents
Domain 2: 56 respondents
Unknown: 2 respondents

Job Position

Position 6: 659 respondents
Unknown: 113 respondents
Position 2: 68 respondents
Position 3: 50 respondents
Position 4: 18 respondents
Position 1: 3 respondents
Position 5: 2 respondents

Next, I'll create visualizations to represent this demographic information more effectively. Let's start with a histogram for age and a bar chart for the domains and job positions.

The visualizations have been created:


Age Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of ages among respondents.
Number of Respondents by Domain: A bar chart illustrating how many respondents belong to each domain.
Number of Respondents by Job Position: A bar chart displaying the number of respondents in various job positions.

Next, let's move on to Task 3, which involves analyzing the survey questions to determine which ones received extreme responses (1 or 5) from the majority of participants. I'll identify these questions and visualize the results.


First, I'll check the columns related to the survey questions to see their structure.

The dataset contains several columns related to survey questions, including PU1, PU2, PU3, PEU1, PEU2, PEU3, ENJ1, ENJ2, Qu1, Qu2, Qu3, Qu4, Qu5, and others.


To identify which questions received extreme responses (1 or 5) from the majority of participants, I'll calculate the percentage of extreme responses for each relevant question. Let's proceed with this analysis.

It appears that none of the survey questions received extreme responses (1 or 5) from the participants, as all percentages are 0%. This could indicate that respondents were more neutral in their answers or that the data may require further investigation.


Next, let's move on to Task 4, which involves analyzing which domains are most and least likely to consult Wikipedia for issues related to their field of expertise, and comparing this with the practice of citing Wikipedia in academic papers.


I'll start by examining the relevant columns that indicate the frequency of Wikipedia usage and the domains of the respondents. Let's analyze the data to find this information.

It seems that there was an issue with calculating the mean for the Wikipedia usage columns, likely due to non-numeric values in those columns. I'll first check the data types of the relevant columns and convert them to numeric if necessary, handling any non-numeric values appropriately. Let's do that now.

The Wikipedia usage columns are of type object, indicating that they contain non-numeric values. I'll convert these columns to numeric, coercing any errors to NaN, and then recalculate the average usage for each domain. Let's proceed with this conversion and analysis.

Here are the average Wikipedia usage scores for each domain:


Domain ?: 4.00
Domain 2: 2.85
Domain 4: 2.82
Domain 1: 2.53
Domain 6: 2.44
Domain 3: 2.31
Domain 5: 2.06

From this analysis, it appears that respondents from Domain ? are the most likely to consult Wikipedia, while those from Domain 5 are the least likely.


Next, let's compare this with the practice of citing Wikipedia in academic papers. To do this, we would typically need to analyze the relevant columns that indicate citation practices. However, it seems that the dataset does not explicitly include a column for citing Wikipedia in academic papers.


If you have any specific columns or additional data related to citation practices, please let me know. Otherwise, we can conclude the analysis based on the current findings.
