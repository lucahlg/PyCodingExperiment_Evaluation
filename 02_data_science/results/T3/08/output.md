Let's start by downloading the dataset and loading it into a Python environment. I'll first check the current directory to see where I can save the dataset.

There are no files in the current directory. I'll download the dataset from the provided URL and extract it. Let's proceed with that.

The dataset has been successfully downloaded and extracted. The file Wholesale customers data.csv is now available.


Next, I'll load the dataset and drop the "Region" column as specified in Task 1. Let's proceed with that.

The dataset has been loaded, and the "Region" column has been successfully dropped. The remaining columns are "Channel," "Fresh," "Milk," "Grocery," "Frozen," "Detergents_Paper," and "Delicassen."


Now, let's move on to Task 2, where we will filter the data records for clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés (i.e., drop clients from retail). The "Channel" column indicates the type of client, where 1 represents "Retail" and 2 represents "Food Service." I'll filter the dataset accordingly.

The dataset has been successfully filtered to include only clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés. The "Channel" column has been removed, and we are left with the spending data across various product categories.


Next, let's proceed to Task 3, where we will normalize the data by computing the proportionate spending per product category (i.e., each row in the data table sums to one). I'll perform this normalization now.

The data has been successfully normalized, with each row now summing to one, representing the proportionate spending per product category.


Next, let's move on to Task 4, where we will standardize the data. This involves scaling the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. I'll perform the standardization now.

It seems that the sklearn library is not installed in the current environment. I'll go ahead and install it now.

The scikit-learn library has been successfully installed. Now, I'll proceed to standardize the normalized data.

The data has been successfully standardized, with each feature now having a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


Next, let's move on to Task 5, where we will use K-means clustering to group the distributor’s customers into K = 4 clusters. I'll perform the clustering now.

The K-means clustering has been successfully performed, and each customer has been assigned to one of the 4 clusters.


Now, let's proceed to Task 6, where we will print and visualize the cluster centroids. I'll calculate the centroids and create a visualization for them.

The cluster centroids have been calculated and visualized. Each bar represents the standardized spending of each cluster across the different product categories.


Now, let's move on to Task 7, where I will provide a short description of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories. I'll analyze the centroids to summarize the characteristics of each cluster.

Here are the descriptions for each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories:


Cluster 0: Fresh spending is low; Milk spending is high; Grocery spending is high; Frozen spending is low; Detergents_Paper spending is low; Delicassen spending is high.

Cluster 1: Fresh spending is low; Milk spending is low; Grocery spending is high; Frozen spending is low; Detergents_Paper spending is high; Delicassen spending is low.

Cluster 2: Fresh spending is high; Milk spending is low; Grocery spending is low; Frozen spending is low; Detergents_Paper spending is low; Delicassen spending is high.

Cluster 3: Fresh spending is high; Milk spending is low; Grocery spending is low; Frozen spending is high; Detergents_Paper spending is low; Delicassen spending is high.


This concludes the customer segmentation analysis. If you have any further questions or need additional tasks, feel free to ask!
