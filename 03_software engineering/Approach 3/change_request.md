You are a full autonomous AI software engineer. You will help me to develop a Smart Fridge Application. You have access to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/lucahlg/smart-fridge-app.git. Everything you need to know about the application and how to set it up is in the README.md file. Make sure to incorporate the changes, modifications and additions to the existing code.
Change request: 
Add a "Delete" button to each unit in the UnitList component to allow users to delete a unit directly from the UI. Make necessary changes to the backend to handle the deletion of a unit.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Each unit in the list has a "Delete" button.
- Clicking the "Delete" button removes the unit from the database and updates the UI.
