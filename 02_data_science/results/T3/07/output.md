Let's start with Task 1, which is to load the dataset and drop the Region column. First, I will download the dataset from the provided URL and then load it into a DataFrame.

I have successfully loaded the dataset and dropped the Region column. Now, let's move on to Task 2, which is to filter the data records for clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés (i.e., drop clients from retail).


I'll filter the dataset based on the Channel column, where 1 represents retail and 2 represents the other types of clients. Let's proceed with this filtering.

The dataset has been successfully filtered to include only clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés. Now, let's proceed to Task 3, which is to normalize the data by computing the proportionate spending per product category (i.e., each row in the data table sums to one).


I'll perform this normalization now.

The data has been successfully normalized, with each row now summing to one. Next, let's move on to Task 4, which is to standardize the data.


I'll standardize the data using the standard score (z-score) method, which involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature. Let's proceed with this standardization.

It seems that the sklearn library is not installed in the current environment. I will install it now and then proceed with the standardization of the data.


Let's install scikit-learn.

The scikit-learn library has been successfully installed. Now, I will proceed with the standardization of the data using the z-score method.

It seems that the kernel needs to be restarted to recognize the newly installed packages. I will restart the kernel and then re-import the necessary libraries to continue with the standardization of the data.


Let's do that now.

The data has been successfully standardized. Now, let's move on to Task 5, which is to use K-means to cluster the distributor’s customers based on the standardized data into ( K = 4 ) groups.


I'll perform the K-means clustering now.

The K-means clustering has been successfully performed, and each customer has been assigned to one of the 4 clusters. Now, let's move on to Task 6, which is to print and visualize the cluster centroids.


I'll extract the cluster centroids and visualize them using a bar plot.

The cluster centroids have been visualized successfully. Each bar represents the standardized spending of each cluster across different product categories.


Now, let's move on to Task 7, which is to offer a short description of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories. I'll analyze the cluster data to provide insights into each cluster's characteristics.

Here are the descriptions of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories:


Cluster 0:

Higher spending on Milk and Grocery.
Moderate spending on Fresh and Delicassen.
Low spending on Frozen and Detergents_Paper.
Cluster 1:

High spending on Milk.
Moderate spending on Delicassen.
Low spending on Fresh, Grocery, Frozen, and Detergents_Paper.
Cluster 2:

High spending on Frozen.
Moderate spending on Fresh.
Low spending on Milk, Grocery, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.
Cluster 3:

Very high spending on Frozen.
Moderate spending on Delicassen.
Low spending on Fresh, Milk, Grocery, and Detergents_Paper.

These insights can help in understanding the different customer segments and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.
