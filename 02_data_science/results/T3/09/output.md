Let's start with Task 1, which is to load the dataset and drop the Region column. First, I'll download the dataset and extract it.

The dataset has been successfully downloaded and extracted. Now, let's load the dataset and drop the Region column. I'll proceed with that using Python.

The dataset has been loaded, and the Region column has been successfully dropped. The remaining columns are Channel, Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.


Now, let's move on to Task 2, which is to filter the data records for clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés (i.e., drop clients from retail). I'll proceed with that now.

The data has been successfully filtered to include only clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés.


Now, let's proceed to Task 3, which is to normalize the data by computing the proportionate spending per product category (i.e., each row in the data table sums to one). I'll perform that normalization now.

The data has been successfully normalized, with each row now summing to one across the product categories.


Next, let's move on to Task 4, which is to standardize the data. I'll perform the standardization now.

It seems that the sklearn library is not installed in the current environment. Let me install it first, and then I'll proceed with the standardization of the data.

The scikit-learn library has been successfully installed. Now, let's proceed with the standardization of the data.

The data has been successfully standardized.


Now, let's move on to Task 5, which is to use K-means to cluster the distributor’s customers based on the standardized data into K = 4 groups. I'll perform the clustering now.

The K-means clustering has been successfully performed, and each customer has been assigned to one of the 4 clusters.


Now, let's move on to Task 6, which is to print and visualize the cluster centroids. I'll calculate the centroids and create a visualization for them.

The cluster centroids have been calculated and visualized successfully. Each line in the plot represents the spending pattern of a cluster across different product categories.


Now, let's proceed to Task 7, which is to offer a short description of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories. I'll analyze the cluster centroids to provide these descriptions.

Here are the descriptions of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories:


Cluster 0:

High spending on Grocery and Detergents_Paper.
Moderate spending on Milk.
Low spending on Fresh, Frozen, and Delicassen.
This group likely consists of clients who prioritize grocery items and cleaning supplies.
Cluster 1:

High spending on Fresh.
Low spending on Milk, Grocery, Detergents_Paper, Frozen, and Delicassen.
This group may represent clients focused on fresh produce, such as restaurants that emphasize fresh ingredients.
Cluster 2:

High spending on Frozen.
Low spending on Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.
This group likely includes clients that rely heavily on frozen products, possibly catering services or establishments with a focus on frozen meals.
Cluster 3:

High spending on Milk and Delicassen.
Moderate spending on Fresh.
Low spending on Grocery, Frozen, and Detergents_Paper.
This group may consist of clients that focus on dairy products and delicacies, such as cafés or specialty food shops.
