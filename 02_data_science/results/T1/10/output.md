Let's start by downloading the data from the provided link. I'll download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

The data has been successfully downloaded and extracted. The CSV file wiki4HE.csv is now available in the wiki4he_data directory.


Next, I'll load the data using a data analysis tool, such as Pandas, to begin processing it. Let's check the contents of the CSV file to understand its structure.

The data appears to be in a semicolon-separated format rather than the default comma-separated format. I'll reload the data using the correct delimiter and then display the first few rows again to confirm the structure.

The data has been successfully loaded with the correct structure. It contains various columns, including demographic information such as age, gender, domain, years of experience, and job position.


Now, let's proceed to provide an overview of the respondents’ demographics, including age, years of experience, domain/field of expertise, and job position. I'll summarize this information and create visualizations for better understanding.

Here is an overview of the respondents’ demographics:


Age

Count: 913
Mean: 42.25 years
Standard Deviation: 8.06 years
Minimum Age: 23 years
Maximum Age: 69 years
Age Distribution: The histogram shows a normal distribution of ages, with most respondents being in their 30s to 50s.

Years of Experience

Count: 913
Unique Values: 37
Most Common Years of Experience: 10 years (77 respondents)
The distribution of years of experience also shows a range, with many respondents having significant experience.

Domain/Field of Expertise

Domain Counts:
Domain 6: 361 respondents
Domain 1: 183 respondents
Domain 4: 137 respondents
Domain 5: 101 respondents
Domain 3: 73 respondents
Domain 2: 56 respondents
Unknown: 2 respondents

Job Position

Job Position Counts:
Position 6: 659 respondents
Unknown: 113 respondents
Position 2: 68 respondents
Position 3: 50 respondents
Position 4: 18 respondents
Position 1: 3 respondents
Position 5: 2 respondents

The visualizations provide a clear representation of the age and years of experience distributions among the respondents.


Next, let's move on to Task 3, where we will analyze which survey questions received extreme responses (1 or 5) from the majority of participants. I'll identify those questions now.

It appears that there are no survey questions for which a majority of respondents (more than 50%) selected extreme responses (1 or 5). This suggests that the participants may have had a more moderate view on the survey questions.


Next, let's proceed to Task 4, where we will analyze which domains are most and least likely to consult Wikipedia for issues related to their field of expertise, and compare this with the practice of citing Wikipedia in academic papers.


I'll start by examining the relevant columns in the dataset that pertain to Wikipedia usage and domain expertise. Let's analyze this data now.

It seems that there are non-numeric values in the columns related to Wikipedia usage and citations, which is causing the error when trying to calculate the mean. I'll first check the data types of the relevant columns and clean any non-numeric entries before proceeding with the analysis. Let's do that now.

It seems that the previous context has been lost, and I need to redefine the relevant variables. Let me redefine the columns for Wikipedia usage and citations, check their data types, and clean any non-numeric entries before proceeding with the analysis.


I'll do that now.

All the relevant columns for Wikipedia usage and citations are of type object, indicating that they may contain non-numeric values or strings. I will convert these columns to numeric, coercing any errors to NaN, and then proceed with the analysis to calculate the average usage and citation rates per domain.


Let's clean the data and perform the analysis now.

Here are the results comparing the average Wikipedia usage and citation rates across different domains:


Domain	Average Wikipedia Usage	Average Citation
?	4.00	4.83
2	2.85	2.34
4	2.82	2.58
1	2.53	2.57
6	2.44	2.70
3	2.31	2.12
5	2.06	2.43

Observations:

Domain ? shows the highest average usage of Wikipedia (4.00) and also has a high average citation rate (4.83).
Domain 2 has a moderate average usage (2.85) and a lower citation rate (2.34).
The remaining domains show decreasing average usage and citation rates, with Domain 5 having the lowest average usage (2.06).

This analysis indicates that there may be a correlation between the frequency of Wikipedia usage and the practice of citing it in academic work, particularly in the domain marked as ?.


If you have any further questions or need additional analysis, please let me know! Otherwise, I can conclude this task.
