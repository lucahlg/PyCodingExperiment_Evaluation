The dataset has been successfully extracted, and the file Wholesale customers data.csv is now available. I'll load this dataset into a DataFrame and drop the Region column as part of Task 1.


Let's proceed with that.

The dataset has been successfully loaded, and the Region column has been dropped. The remaining columns include Channel, Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.


Now, let's move on to Task 2, where we will filter the data records for clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés by dropping clients from retail. The Channel column indicates the type of client, where 1 represents "Retail" and 2 represents "Food Service".


I'll filter the DataFrame accordingly.

The data has been successfully filtered to include only clients that are restaurants, hotels, and cafés.


Next, let's proceed to Task 3, where we will normalize the data by computing the proportionate spending per product category, ensuring that each row in the data table sums to one.


I'll perform the normalization now.

The data has been successfully normalized, with each row now representing the proportionate spending per product category.


Next, let's move on to Task 4, where we will standardize the data. This involves scaling the data so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


I'll perform the standardization now.

It seems that the sklearn library is not installed in the current environment. I'll install it now so that we can proceed with the standardization of the data.


Let's go ahead and install scikit-learn.

The scikit-learn library has been successfully installed. Now, I'll proceed to standardize the data as planned in Task 4.


Let's perform the standardization now.

It seems that the kernel needs to be restarted to recognize the newly installed packages. I'll restart the kernel and then re-import the necessary libraries to standardize the data.


Let's do that now.

The data has been successfully standardized, with each feature now having a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


Next, let's move on to Task 5, where we will use K-means clustering to group the distributor’s customers into K = 4 clusters based on the standardized data.


I'll perform the K-means clustering now.

The K-means clustering has been successfully performed, and each customer has been assigned to one of the 4 clusters.


Now, let's move on to Task 6, where we will print and visualize the cluster centroids. I'll extract the centroids and create a visualization for them.


Let's proceed with that.

The cluster centroids have been successfully visualized, and the values for each product category across the clusters are displayed in the table.


Now, let's move on to Task 7, where we will offer a short description of each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories.


I'll analyze the centroids to provide a description for each cluster.

Here are the descriptions for each group of clients based on their annual spending across product categories:


Cluster 0: Low spending on Fresh. High spending on Milk. High spending on Grocery. Low spending on Frozen. Low spending on Detergents and Paper. High spending on Delicassen.

Cluster 1: Low spending on Fresh. Low spending on Milk. High spending on Grocery. Low spending on Frozen. High spending on Detergents and Paper. Low spending on Delicassen.

Cluster 2: High spending on Fresh. Low spending on Milk. Low spending on Grocery. Low spending on Frozen. Low spending on Detergents and Paper. High spending on Delicassen.

Cluster 3: High spending on Fresh. Low spending on Milk. Low spending on Grocery. High spending on Frozen. Low spending on Detergents and Paper. High spending on Delicassen.


This completes the customer segmentation task. If you have any further questions or need additional analysis, feel free to ask!
